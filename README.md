Plea is a high-level esolang that is named due to the fact that you have to beg in order for the program to run.

After Plea 1.0 is completed, Plea updates will slowly make the language worse until it is an unusable mess, and updates will also have no respect for backwards compatibility.

If you're interested, you can go to the [esolangs.org page](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Plea).
