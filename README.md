# Plea
> [!WARNING]
> This interpreter is currently a work in progress and as such is very limited.

A high-level esoteric programming language.

## Usage
`plea <source file>`

## Examples
There are three sample programs in the examples folder. The first program is a cat program, which is a program that prints whatever you input into it (though Plea's cat program is currently limited to just one character per input (NOTE: It kinda works with multiple characters due to how scanf works)), the second program is self-explanatory, and the third program is meant to show the capabilities of the Plea interpreter.
